What my team and I have developed is a E-Commerce site that empowers customers to both buy and sell their own products. Key features include:

- Search and Order: Users can search for items using a search bar or categories, with dynamic product retrieval. Products can be ordered from the product or results page.
  
- Payment and Confirmation: Customers can pay with a credit card, and purchase confirmations are sent via email.

- User Roles: Different types of users, including vendors who can upload products.

- Order Management and Personalized Dashboards: Buyers can view their order history while sellers can view the list of people who have purchased specific products of theirs. Additionally, sellers are allowed to view a personal product dashboard that allows them to add and delete products to the site. A table with all of the product details are made visible only to them

- Shipping Options: Users enter their address and choose from available shipping methods (pickup, fast delivery, regular delivery).

For the development of this website that me and my 3 partners have created, we utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. Our method of running this was via a localhost run through MAMP and PHPMyAdmin, in which our database and tables for querying were stored.

Credit goes out not only to me, but also Hashminth (hash2003), Russell / Ruslan (netiRussell), and Niall-Barrett.
